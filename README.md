# HOTEL-WIFI

The setup consists of 4 hotel rooms and 7 wifi access points. All the 7 wifi APs are accessible from each room, but with different signal strengths. The signal strengths are in dBm. The task is to train a model which can accurately predict the room number, given the strengths of wifi signals from all the seven APs.
